# YAM3G (Yet Another Match 3 Game)

YAM3G is a simple match 3 game currently in development.

It is not meant to be original in any way, but as a learning project to get more experience with the [F265Jr/K hardware](https://c256foenix.com/f256-jr) and 65c02 assembler.

## Music

The music for YAM3G is created by [Crisps](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSK9HoEVmgxcUUcGPliCyBg). As with the rest of the project this is provided as 'open source', 
so we include the sng files in the 'source_media' folder (these can be edited using the Goat Tracker). The same license applies as to the rest of the project.

## Running the game

To run the game, put your Jr/K in ram boot mode and upload the bin file to address: $0000.
